**WUNO STEALER**: A Safe and Educational Side Project
WUNO is **NOT** a stealer or logger; it is designed to be 100% safe. This project offers a unique approach by loading a script and a logger simultaneously while immersing you in a game environment with no players, enhancing efficiency.

Key Features
Enhanced Performance: this stealer operates more efficiently than other tools, such as Dark scripts.
Simultaneous Loading: It loads both the script of your liking and logger at the same time, optimizing resource usage.
